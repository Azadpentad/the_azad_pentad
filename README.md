Rectifying Cosmology: 5D Universal Plenum Theory (Ref #17680744)
The Living Manifold Hypothesis (Ref #17680744)
​Definition: The 5D Manifold is a singular, self-sustaining living entity.
​Biological Independence: Life and Mind are fundamental constants of the Pentad and exist independently of any biological medium or physical carrier.
​Interaction: What we perceive as "physical laws" are the habitual behaviors of this Living Manifold as it maintains the state of Absolute Persistence (\Psi).
​Unity: Every localized point in Space (S) and Mass (M) is an integrated part of the total Living System.

# The Azad Pentad: Absolute Persistence (Ref #17680744)

Official repository for the 5D Stationary Manifold framework.

## **Theoretical Overview**
The Azad Pentad replaces the "Expanding Universe" theory with the principle of **Absolute Persistence**. 

### **The Master Equation**
**(S · T · E · L · M) = Ψ**
* **L = sec(θ)** (The Linearity Law / Bending Ruler Effect)
* **dΨ / dt = 0** (The Invariance Principle)

### **Key Postulates**
* **Gravity as Behavior:** Gravity is not a force but the 5D manifold's response to maintaining Ψ.
* **Non-Biological Life:** Mind and Life are fundamental 5D constants that require no physical medium to persist.
* **Stationarity:** Redshift is a geometric distortion ($L$) of the observer interface, not recession velocity.
