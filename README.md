Rectifying Cosmology: 5D Universal Plenum Theory (Ref #17680744)
The Living Manifold Hypothesis (Ref #17680744)
​Definition: The 5D Manifold is a singular, self-sustaining living entity.
​Biological Independence: Life and Mind are fundamental constants of the Pentad and exist independently of any biological medium or physical carrier.
​Interaction: What we perceive as "physical laws" are the habitual behaviors of this Living Manifold as it maintains the state of Absolute Persistence (\Psi).
​Unity: Every localized point in Space (S) and Mass (M) is an integrated part of the total Living System.
